Simulated Machine Data Analysis and Forecasting

Project Overview

This project focuses on the simulation, preprocessing, and analysis of machine-generated data for anomaly detection and predictive modeling. The dataset is synthetically generated to mimic real-world industrial scenarios, including parameters like internal temperature, outdoor temperature, RPM, vibration, and pressure. It incorporates realistic dependencies, periodic patterns, noise, and random anomalies (e.g., machine failures), making it suitable for testing various data science and machine learning techniques.

Goals

	1.	Data Simulation:
	•	Generate multivariate time series data with realistic interdependencies and patterns.
	•	Introduce anomalies (e.g., unexpected spikes or drops) and events (e.g., machine failures).
	2.	Data Preprocessing:
	•	Cleaning, smoothing, scaling, and standardizing the dataset.
	•	Handling missing values and outliers.
	3.	Data Analysis:
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
	•	Feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.
	4.	Machine Learning:
	•	Implement anomaly detection techniques (e.g., Isolation Forest).
	•	Explore forecasting models, such as ARIMA, LSTM, or other advanced methods, to predict future values.

Technologies Used

	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Data Simulation: NumPy, Pandas
	•	Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
	•	Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for future modeling)
	•	Preprocessing: Pandas, Scikit-learn
