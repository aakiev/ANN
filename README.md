# Simulated Machine Data Analysis and Forecasting

## Overview
This repository hosts a Python-based project designed for the simulation, preprocessing, and analysis of machine-generated data. The project focuses on detecting anomalies and building predictive models for industrial scenarios. Synthetic datasets are generated to mimic real-world conditions, incorporating realistic dependencies, periodic patterns, noise, and random anomalies such as machine failures.

This initiative combines data science and machine learning techniques with a practical approach to industrial data, offering a comprehensive exploration of time series analysis and predictive modeling.

## Key Objectives
1. **Data Simulation**
   - Generate multivariate time series data with realistic interdependencies and patterns.
   - Introduce anomalies (e.g., unexpected spikes or drops) and events (e.g., machine failures).

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean, smooth, scale, and standardize the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and outliers effectively.

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
   - Perform feature engineering to extract meaningful insights from the data.

4. **Machine Learning**
   - Implement anomaly detection techniques, such as Isolation Forest.
   - Explore forecasting models like ARIMA, LSTM, and other advanced methods to predict future values.

## Core Features
1. **Synthetic Data Generation**
   - Create realistic datasets to simulate industrial conditions and challenges.
   - Embed dependencies between variables such as internal temperature, RPM, and vibration.

2. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Identify irregularities in the data using machine learning techniques.

3. **Time Series Forecasting**
   - Predict future trends using advanced models such as LSTM or ARIMA.

4. **Visualization**
   - Generate insightful charts and graphs to analyze trends and anomalies.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Simulation**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for advanced modeling)
